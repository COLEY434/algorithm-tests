Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

Example
s1 = "and"
s2 = "art"

These share the common substring a.

s1 = "be"
s2 = "cat"

These do not share a substring.

Function Description

- string s1: a string
- string s2: another string
Returns

- string: either YES or NO

Constraints

- s1 and s2 consist of characters in the range ascii[a-z].
- 1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 10^5

Output Format

For each pair of strings, return YES or NO.

1) s1= "hello", s2 = "world"
2) s1 = "hi", s2 = "world"
